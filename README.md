# Flight-delay-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

In this project we can see that we have numerical variables and some categorical variales, in our Data Visualization we can see that we have some Airlines that has more Delays than Anothers, the same thing when we See the Airports, its interesting that we have almost the same values in Delays and Not Delays.

When we look at machine learning models, we can't get a good models to preview when we have delay when we use our Original Data, even when we Scaling the data, then i decided to create new variables using your original data, transforming some values in groups, like Airline, Airport From and Airport To.

But even so we ended up not being able to create a good model to predict when the plane will have a delay with this data that we have available, to predict if the plane will not have a delay we got some good models.

Other interesting thing to see is the most important variables in the Decision Tree and Random ForestModel, We can see that the most important variable of model is Airline and our Second Variable is "Time", which shows us that these are the variables that most explain when the Flight will be Delayed or Not.

Maybe if we have more informations about the flights like such as weather forecast, time of year, or things that influence the use of planes, we could get better results.
